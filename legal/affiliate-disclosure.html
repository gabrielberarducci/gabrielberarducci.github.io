            <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
            <p><em>Last Updated: July 21, 2024</em></p>

            <p>At QLD Adventure Gear, our goal is to provide you with the best possible advice, reviews, and guides for 4x4, camping, and overlanding equipment suited for Queensland's unique conditions. We believe in honesty and transparency with our audience.</p>

            <h2>What Are Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>Some of the links on our website (qldadventuregear.example.com) are "affiliate links." This means that if you click on one of these links and subsequently make a purchase from the retailer, we may earn a small commission. This commission comes at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong>.</p>
            <p>For example, we participate in programs like the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, and similar affiliate programs with retailers such as BCF, Snowys, and Anaconda. These programs are designed to provide a means for sites like ours to earn advertising fees by linking to their products.</p>

            <h2>Why Do We Use Affiliate Links?</h2>
            <p>Running a website like QLD Adventure Gear involves costs â€“ from web hosting and design to the time and effort spent researching, testing, and writing content. Affiliate commissions help us to cover these costs and allow us to continue creating high-quality, free content for our readers.</p>
            <p>Think of it as a way to support our work without it costing you anything extra. If you find our content helpful and decide to purchase a product we've recommended, using our affiliate link is a great way to show your appreciation.</p>

            <h2>Our Promise to You</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Editorial Integrity:</strong> Our reviews and recommendations are based on our own research, testing, and honest opinions. We are not paid to write positive reviews, and our affiliate partnerships do not influence the products we choose to feature or our assessment of them.</li>
                <li><strong>No Extra Cost:</strong> Clicking an affiliate link and purchasing a product will not cost you any more than if you went directly to the retailer's site. The commission is paid by the retailer as a thank you for referring a customer.</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> We only link to products and services that we genuinely believe are relevant and beneficial to our audience of Queensland adventurers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Trust is Important</h2>
            <p>We value the trust you place in us when seeking advice on gear for your adventures. We strive to be upfront about how we operate and how we are compensated. If you have any questions about our affiliate disclosure or any of the products we recommend, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your support!</p>
