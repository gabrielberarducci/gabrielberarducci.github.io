            <h1>About QLD Adventure Gear</h1>
            <p>G'day! We're a couple of passionate Queenslanders who live and breathe adventure. From the misty peaks of the Glass House Mountains to the rugged tracks of Cape York, and everywhere in between – if there's a dirt road, a hidden campsite, or a stunning vista, we're probably planning our next trip there (or already have a story to tell!).</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, we've spent countless hours (and a fair bit of cash!) kitting out our 4x4s, campers, and utes. We've learned the hard way what works in Queensland's diverse and often challenging conditions – from the sweltering summer heat and humidity to the sudden downpours and corrugated roads. We know the difference between gear that looks good in the showroom and gear that actually performs when you're a hundred k's from the nearest town.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission here at QLD Adventure Gear is simple: to share our honest, real-world experience and provide practical advice to help you get the most out of your adventures. We're not about flogging the latest fads or the most expensive kit. We're about finding gear that offers genuine value, reliability, and suitability for exploring this magnificent state.</p>
            
            <p>We believe that everyone should be able to explore Queensland with confidence. That means having equipment you can trust, set up in a way that makes your trips comfortable and hassle-free. Whether you're a seasoned overlander planning an epic Cape trip, a family heading out for a weekend camping by the beach, or a tradie looking to optimise your ute for work and play, we aim to provide insights that help you make informed decisions.</p>

            <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
